Simple Calendar

using plain old javascript.

The `tsconfig.json` file in this project is the bare minimum tsconfig
that we needed for this setup to work.

This project uses:

- `pug` -> `html`
- `scss` -> `css`
- `ts` -> `js`

The build is stored in `./dist`

At the moment, there is no bundler setup or anything here, the build is
done by the vscode extension named `CompileHero`
